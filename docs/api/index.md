# SORACOM API

## Example
### Authentication
To execute API calls from this page, you must first authenticate your SORACOM account using one of the following authentication methods:

- **Root Account** - authenticate using your SORACOM `email` and `password` login information
- **AuthKey** - authenticate using a `AuthKeyID` and `AuthKey`

Once authenticated, an API key will be generated and will automatically be appended to any API calls executed on this page.

Each API call will be executed in the selected coverage area (API endpoint), Global or Japan. If your account has been approved for multi-region coverage, you can switch API endpoints.
